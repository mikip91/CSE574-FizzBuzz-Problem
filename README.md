# CSE574-FizzBuzz-Problem
 Implement FizzBuzz problem using Machine Learning algorithms. 
 
 **Problem DeÔ¨Ånition:**
 * If an integer is divisible by 3, then the output should be Fizz.
 * If the integer divisible by 5 the output should be Buzz. 
 * An integer divisible by both 3 and 5 should return an output of FizzBuzz. 
 * If an integer is not divisible by 3 or 5 or 15, it should simply print Other.
